<h2>About Me:</h2>
Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Hawaii Pacific University with a clear goal of  
becoming a Cybersecurity Analyst. 
As a dedicated and driven professional, Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning 
Through intensive training in core areas such as CompTIA Security+, Linux+, and Splunk, Iâ€™ve gained
a strong foundation in network security, system administration, and security information and event management (SIEM). 
In addition to technical skills, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to receive professional development and career mentorship
that has sharpened my understanding of real-world cybersecurity challenges and best practices.
Iâ€™m excited to deepen my expertise, earn industry-recognized certifications, and gain practical experience
through internships, mentorships, or collaborative projects. My mission is to transition seamlessly into the cybersecurity
field and contribute to protecting systems and data in todayâ€™s complex digital landscape.
Iâ€™m always looking to connect with like-minded professionals, mentors, and organizations focused
on cybersecurity innovation, education, and community. Letâ€™s connect and grow together!
